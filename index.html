    <div class="wishes">In the tapestry of time, six months unfold,<br>
        A journey of love, a story yet untold.<br>
        Five centuries of love, strong and true,<br>
        With every beat, my heart belongs to you.<br>
        Four seasons witnessed our love's embrace,<br>
        Winter may come, but our flame won't wane,<br>
        Three words echo in every whisper of the breeze,<br>
        "I love you" carried by the rustling leaves.<br>
        Two souls united, a cosmic dance,<br>
        In this universe of love, we've found our chance.<br>
        One love, one heartbeat, as time marches on,<br>
        In the infinity of us, a bond that's never gone.<br>
        Happy 6 months, my love, to many more to come,<br>
        With you, every day is a celebration, a love so warm.</div>
